Formatters
==========

Formatters create a data structure and applies data into it.

Formatters are classes that contain the logic of how to format your data.
They receive data and a format based on your configuration or fake data for you.

Developing new formatters is as easy as as baking a pop-tart. All you have to do is implement a new class and provide your format and data structures. You can check the Apache Access Log implementation as a reference.

To list all formatters run:

.. code-block:: bash

 mouth list formatters
