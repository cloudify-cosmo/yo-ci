============
InHouseFaker
============

feeder uses `fake factory <https://github.com/joke2k/faker>`_ to generate most of its random data.
While it provides a large number of useful random fields, some data types are missing from it.

I do want to send some pull requests with updates to fake-factory.. but for now.. an InHouseFaker was implemented.
The InHouseFaker class in the format_mappings module returns random data for some data types if they cannot be generated by fake-factory.

You can easily contribute to it though I'd suggest contributing to fake-factory instead as feeder isn't meant to provide this functionality for a long term.
